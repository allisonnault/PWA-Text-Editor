[deployed application](https://pure-brook-96566.herokuapp.com/)
    
## Description
    
This is a text editor that runs in a browser. This app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques taht server as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application also functions offline. 

I stared with an existing application and implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. I used a package called 'idb', which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API.
